## Load packages 

I installed and read important packages for my data

```{r}
library(readxl)     # load readxl, for reading Excel files
library(tidyverse)  # load tidyverse, for working with datasets

```

##Read the data

Next I read the finches data

```{r}
finches <- read_excel("finches_data.xlsx")
```

The finch data was printed 

```{r}
finches
```

I then looked at the variables within the dataset
```{r}
glimpse(finches)
```

## Histogram
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
